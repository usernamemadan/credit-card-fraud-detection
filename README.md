Cedit card fraud analysis using Machine learning models

The main objective of the credit card fraud analysis is to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.


The steps involved in the project are:

1. exploring the dataset also visualizing the data set

2. Data preprocessing

3. building machine learning models

4. evaluating the models

5. applying StandardScaler to obtain all the features

6. Using Test-Train split.  

7. Compiling and fiting

8. final model creation and analysis outcome.





Final result of analysis:
The accuracy obtained is 95% (CNN model)
